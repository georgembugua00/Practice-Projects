# Machine Learning Practice - George Mbugua

# Description:

This repository serves as a central hub for my ongoing exploration of machine learning algorithms. It includes theoretical explanations, practical implementations in Jupyter Notebooks, and (optionally) additional resources that facilitate learning and experimentation.

# Contents:

## Theory:
Subdirectories (optional): Create subdirectories within the theory folder to organize explanations for different machine learning concepts or algorithms (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
Markdown files: Within each subdirectory (or directly in theory if not using subdirectories), create Markdown files named descriptively (e.g., linear_regression_theory.md, decision_tree_theory.md) to provide clear and concise theoretical explanations. Consider including:

## Definitions and key concepts
Mathematical formulations (if applicable)

## Assumptions and limitations
Visual aids (diagrams, illustrations)
References to relevant sources (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX)

# Notebooks:
Jupyter Notebooks: This directory houses Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) that showcase practical implementations of the algorithms:
Each notebook should have a clear and descriptive title (e.g., linear_regression_implementation.ipynb).

Employ well-structured code cells with comments explaining each step:
Data loading and preparation: Explain how data is loaded from external sources or created synthetically.

Model definition and training: Clearly define the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process.
Evaluation: Outline how the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or others relevant to your task.

Visualization (optional): Include visualizations (e.g., plots, confusion matrices) to enhance understanding of the model's behavior and performance.

# Setup and Usage:

## Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later recommended) and the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) installed. Installation instructions can often be found on the library's website or official documentation.
Running the notebooks:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
Use the jupyter notebook command to launch Jupyter Notebook. This will usually open a web browser window where you can interact with the notebooks.

# Contributing (optional):

If you'd like others to contribute to your repository, provide clear guidelines on how to:

Fork the repository.
Make changes locally.
Submit a pull request for review and potential merging.
